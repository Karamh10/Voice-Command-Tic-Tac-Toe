# Voice-Command-Tic-Tac-Toe

This Tic Tac Toe game was written in hopes of making the game accessible and user friendly for kids with visual impairment.
This game can be played using 3 input methods: voice commands, keyboard, and mouse.

### How to play:
The board is split up as follows: 
```
[1] [2] [3]
[4] [5] [6]
[7] [8] [9]
```
- Use the mouse to move the cursor and click whatever box you want.
- Use the numbers on the keyboard to select the cell that you want.
- Select the voice recognition button and say the cell number that you want.

### Features:
- The board's main feature is voice recognition.
- To the top left of the board, there are multiple buttons to change the colors and contrast of the game to aid with the visual impairment.
- Also on the left side, are buttons that the user can use to request the voice control to read outloud the state of the board, the X/O marks, or the empty locations on the board.
- There also buttons that can be used to increase the speed of reading or slow it down, as well as buttons to increase the font or decrease it in order to satisfy the needs of the user.

## What you need:
Download all the files in this repo as they will be used to give you the full experience of the game.
